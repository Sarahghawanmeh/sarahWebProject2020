    <p> <b>Smile </b> <br>
        You tend to smile when you're happy. But it's actually a two-way street.<br>
        
        We smile because we're happy, and smiling causes the brain to release dopamine, which makes us happier.<br>
        
        That doesn't mean you have to go around with a fake smile plastered on your face all the time. But the next time you find yourself feeling low, crack a smile and see what happens. Or try starting each morning by smiling at yourself in the mirror.</p>
