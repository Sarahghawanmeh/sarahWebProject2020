And this is my website, this is a game that last for a week, the purpose of this game is to cheer people up when they are sad, I really want to let people know that their problems matter and it's ok not to be ok sometimes! And I'm just trying to find ways to make their life a little bit better! Anyways I hope you will enjoy the game bye!</p><br>
