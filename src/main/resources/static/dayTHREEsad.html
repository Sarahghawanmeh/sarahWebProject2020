  <b>  Breathe deeply</b><br>
You're tense, your shoulders are tight, and you feel as though you just might "lose it"". We all know that feeling.

Instinct may tell you to take a long, deep breath to calm yourself down.

Turns out, that instinct is a good
one. According to Harvard Health, deep breathing exercises can help
reduce stress.<br>

The next time you feel stressed or at your wit's end, work through these steps:<br>

Close your eyes. Try to envision a happy memory or beautiful place.<br>
Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose.<br>
Slowly breathe out through your mouth or nose.<br>
Repeat this process several times, until you start to feel yourself calm down.<br>
If you're having a hard time taking slow, deliberate breaths, try counting to 5 in your head with each inhale and exhale.<br>
