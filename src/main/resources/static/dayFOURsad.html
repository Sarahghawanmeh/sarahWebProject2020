    <b>See friends</b> <br>
    Humans are social beings, and having close friends can make us happier.<br>
    
    Who do you miss? Reach out to them. Make a date to get together or simply have a long phone chat.<br>
    
    In adulthood, it can feel next to impossible to make new friends. But it's not about how many friends you have. It's about having meaningful relationships even if it's just with one or
    two people.<br>
    
    Try getting involved in a local volunteer group or taking a class. Both can help to connect you with like-minded people in your area. And chances are, they're looking for friends, too.<br>
    
    Companionship doesn't have to be limited to other humans. Pets can offer similar benefits, according to multiple studies.<br>
    
    Love animals but can't have a pet? Consider volunteering at a local animal shelter to make some new friends â€” both human and animal.<br>
