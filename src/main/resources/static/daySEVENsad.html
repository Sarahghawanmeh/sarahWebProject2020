    <b>Plan your week </b> <br>
    Feel like you're flailing about? Try sitting down at the end of every week and making a basic list for the following week.<br>
    
    Even if you don't stick to the plan, blocking out time where you can do laundry, go grocery shopping, or tackle projects at work can help to quiet your mind.<br>
    
    You can get a fancy planner, but even a sticky note on your computer or piece of scrap paper in your pocket can do the job.<br>
