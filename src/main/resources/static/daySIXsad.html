    <b>Take yourself out </b> <br>

No one to go out with? Well, what rule says you can't go out alone?<br>

Go to your favorite restaurant, take in a movie, or go on that trip you've always dreamed of.<br>

Even if you're a social butterfly, spending some deliberate time alone can help you reconnect with the activities that truly make you happy.<br>
