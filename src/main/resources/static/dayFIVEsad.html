   <b> Create a thought list</b> <br>
    You arrive for an appointment with 10 minutes to spare. What do you do with that time? Pick up your cell phone to scroll through social media? Worry about the busy week you have ahead of you?<br>
    
    Take control of your thoughts during these brief windows of time.<br>
    
    At the start of each month, make a short list of happy memories or things you're looking forward to on a small piece of paper or on your phone.<br>
    
    When you find yourself waiting for a ride, standing in line at the grocery store, or just with a few minutes to kill, break out the list. You can even use it when you're just generally feeling down and need to change up your thoughts.<br>
